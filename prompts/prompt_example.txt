# Ontology from text:

Extract an ontology. Do not draw it, but create a markdown table of relations with 3 columns in this order: source, target, relation name. And also create a list with 2 columns: the first contains the term name and the second column contains the term definition.

Use this text as a basis to create the ontology:

```
Cold Arctic air will bring snow, ice and travel disruption to parts of the UK next week.
The Met Office has issued yellow snow and ice warnings as temperatures are expected to plunge over the coming days. Liam Eslick, a meteorologist, said that temperatures will be about 5C to 6C lower than usual for this time of year.
A snow and ice warning is in place from 3am on Monday until 9am on Tuesday across Northern Ireland. In Scotland a similar warning is in place in northern areas from midnight on Sunday until midnight on Monday. The warning area will then spread across the whole of Scotland and into northern England on Tuesday.
```

When printing out the table with the ontologies, can you please surround the markdown tables with a code block? This is done by adding 3 backticks (```) before and after the table. This will make it easier to copy and paste the table into a markdown file.
